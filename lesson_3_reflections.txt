When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you need to cooperate with remote people or when you want to make your code available for te public to manipulate

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since you wanna see if you are intersted in the changes
